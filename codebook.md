* Subjects: Categorical variable signifying which subject was being measured. There are 30 total subjects.
* Activities: Categorical variable signifiying which activity a given subject was participating in during measurement. This includes: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

---All of the following measurements were represented by their mean per subject per activity in the tidy data set---
* tBodyAcc-mean()-X: Continuous variable of mean body acceleration over the X direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y: Continuous variable of mean body acceleration over the Y direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z: Continuous variable of mean body acceleration over the Z direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
* tBodyAcc-std()-X: Continuous variable of standard deviation of body acceleration over the X direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
* tBodyAcc-std()-Y: Continuous variable of standard deviation of body acceleration over the Y direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
* tBodyAcc-std()-Z: Continuous variable of standard deviation of body acceleration over the Z direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
* tGravityAcc-mean()-X: Continuous variable of mean gravity acceleration over the X direction normalized into a -1 to 1 range.
